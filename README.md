For my resume style, I chose to go with the branch archetype "The Regular Guy". As mentioned, this archetype is down to earth, relatable, and seeks connection. 

When choosing a font for this resume, I want it not only to be readable but straightforward and to the point. This led me to use Verdana as my font. 

The color of the font is gray (#333) to keep the resume looking neutral.

The Background image I chose to use, which is also by Salah Regouane on Unsplash, is some guys playing basketball together on a court outside. I would play sports and video games as hobbies and I thought being able to enjoy it wilth others always made it more fun which is what led me to choosing this background.![Resume Screenshot](https://github.com/ckv3500/IS218-Assignment2/assets/54951514/fb9d85b3-a1c3-4660-8042-cf4916a9c7ac)
